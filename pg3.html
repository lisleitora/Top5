    <td style="width: 24.8202%; height: 79.0125px;">He is a shinigami (demigod of death) and basically all he does througout the manga is watch and laugh abt it. That's why he's so relatable, he doesn't really care abot what happens in the story, it's just like he is reading with you and not just a character in the story.</td>
